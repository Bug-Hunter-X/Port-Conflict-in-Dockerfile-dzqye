EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["node", "index.js"]

# Solution: Change to a different port or check for conflicts
# Check if another container or process is using port 3000.  If so, either stop it or change the EXPOSE instruction in your Dockerfile to a different port number not already in use. For example:

#EXPOSE 3001 # changed port to 3001
